	Arrests happen. Believe me I know. I have seen things that will make you shake your head. I have handled cases that caused me to lose sleep at night. I defended people accused of unthinkable crimes. I have seen good police officers make bad decisions and bad police officers make even worse. I have defended college students who made questionable decisions. Medical professionals worried that they may never be able to practice again. Husbands worried that they have hugged their wives and children for the last time. Vacationers at the wrong place at the wrong time. Not every arrest is valid. In fact, many arrests are unlawful. The criminal justice system can suck you in. And once you’re in it, it is very difficult to get out of. Don’t allow yourself to be a victim of this vicious cycle. If you find yourself arrested or facing criminal charges than you need an experienced defense attorney on your side. Don’t face the criminal justice system alone. As your Broward County criminal defense attorney, I can help. I have made a career out of successfully defending and fighting for those accused of crimes. Whether you have been arrested for a small misdemeanor offense or for a homicide, I can help. Here is a sampling of some criminal defense practice areas where I can assist you.
